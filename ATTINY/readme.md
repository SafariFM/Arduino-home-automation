ATTINY sketches for sensors on 433Mhz. These sketches use the [NewRemoteSwitch](https://github.com/hjgode/homewatch/tree/master/arduino/libraries/NewRemoteSwitch) as 433Mhz library. All these sketches use the sleep function in the ATTINY to reduce power consumption. So you can run them on batteries.
