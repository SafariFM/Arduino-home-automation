Arduino sketches for sensors on 433Mhz and 2.4Ghz (MySensors). These sketches use the [NewRemoteSwitch](https://github.com/hjgode/homewatch/tree/master/arduino/libraries/NewRemoteSwitch) as 433Mhz library or the [customized MySensors library](https://github.com/sweebee/Arduino-home-automation/tree/master/libraries/MySensors).
