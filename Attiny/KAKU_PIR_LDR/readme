A simple KAKU Pir with a LDR to measure the light. If its darker than a certain value the pir will trigger. If its lighter than a certain value the pir won't trigger.

Sends a TRUE signal if motion is detected. If there's no more motion it sends a FALSE signal after the timer has finished.

Attiny sleeps by default and wakes from the interrupt pin where the PIR is connected.
